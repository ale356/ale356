# Full-Stack Developer | AI Integration | Backend Systems

I build production systems that handle real traffic — REST APIs serving thousands of daily requests, database schemas managing millions of records, and AI-powered platforms with sub-200ms response times.

Currently working as a Full-Stack Developer at an IT company in Sweden, where I architect web platforms, develop API integrations for external partners, and manage production infrastructure with Docker.
